These are the complete development and handin files from one of my 4th year projects. 

The assignment brief and provided image set is in the 'Context' sub-directory.
'Development files' contains all of the working versions used, with many supporting scripts used as tests and proof-of-concepts.
'Final Handins' contains the final report and final script handin

In summary; 30 reference images were provided, with 440 total apples. This algorithim can succesfully detect 437.

The final program was asked to take images from a 'data' sub-directory, work without user input, and return the final results.
